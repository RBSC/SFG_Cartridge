Yamaha SFG 05/01-S Cartridge Extension Board v1.0
Copyright (c) 2017 RBSC

About
-----

The separate extension board was created for the SFG cartridge in order to make available standard SFG sockets - left and right
RCA audio sockets, music keyboard socked and MIDI IN and MIDI OUT sockets. The board can be either mounted on top of the
cartridge or it can be connected to the cartridge with the standard IDE ribbon cable.

IMPORTANT! When connecting the ribbon cable or plugging the extension board on top of the cartridge please make sure that you are
connecting correctly, otherwise damage may occur to your SFG cartridge! Don't solder the straight pin male IDE connector to the
place where the IDE angled pin female connector should be soldered. The pins of those 2 connectors are vertically reversed! The
IDE ribbon cable must be connected only to the straight pin male connector on the extension board.
